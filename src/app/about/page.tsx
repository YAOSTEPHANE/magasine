          <p>
            Founded by Noya Industries and published from Abidjan, Global South Watch is a digital
            news portal dedicated to Africa and the wider Global South. We bring together
            journalists, correspondents, columnists, and experts based across the continent and in
            the diaspora.
          </p>
          <p>
            From elections and economic policy to culture, climate, and health, we cover the
            stories that shape societies south of the equator — for readers who want reliable
            reporting without Western-centric filters.

          We believe quality journalism rooted in local realities is essential to understanding
          global transformations and building informed public debate. Our mission is to give readers
          the context, evidence, and voices they need to engage with the world on equal terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not chase clicks at the expense of accuracy. We invest in correspondents on the
          ground, long-form investigations, and formats that reach audiences wherever they are —
          from morning briefings to in-depth reports.
